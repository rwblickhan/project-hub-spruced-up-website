## Notes

* Make sure to check out the [Three.js
  documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html)!
* There are also a lot of fun, official [Three.js
  examples](https://threejs.org/examples/) that show off different features of
  Three.js, with full source code - it's highly recommended if you want to keep
  going after this workshop.
* Our ''official'' solution can be found on the [`full`
  branch](https://github.com/rwblickhan/project-hub-spruced-up-website/tree/full),
  but do try to finish the workshop without peeking!
